Things that will be done...
For the DOE file
First copy and paste the text of the table of contents
Al the topics are at the letter. <name of topic> followed by description and contact
Use that information to find the substring and subsequent text that happens after it

Will want to also get the award ceiligns and amoutnhs and that is at the 
number. explanation
You ahve the program overview in blue texts
You have the organization, the topic, and subtopics

tableOfContents.txt has the full table of contents with each line representing either the agency, topic, or subtopic
topicDescriptions.txt has all the lines of text that includes the above...
